<div class="card">
    <p style="color: white;">American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language[4] that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States of America and most of Anglophone Canada. ASL is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features.[5] Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.

        ASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in West Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults and other hearing individuals.</p>

<div class="card">
    <p style="color: white;">Prior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States.[6]: 5  In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation.[6]: 5  As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines</p>

<div class="card">
    <p style="color: white;">ASL is used throughout Anglo-America.[7]: 12  That contrasts with Europe, where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent.[7]: 12  The unique situation of ASL seems to have been caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the Deaf, wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the Deaf.[7]: 12–14 

        Throughout West Africa, ASL-based sign languages are signed by educated Deaf adults.[23]: 410  Such languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly, such as Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language.[23]: 410  Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo.[23]: 406  Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of ASL used in America.</p>

<div class="card">
    <p style="color: white;">ASL has a rich system of verbal inflection, which involves both grammatical aspect: how the action of verbs flows in time—and agreement marking.[6]: 27–28  Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position.[6]: 27–28  Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity.[6]: 28  Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT[reciprocal], articulated by having two L-shaped hands "shooting" at each other.[</p>

<div class="card">
    <p style="color: white;">ASL is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but various phenomena affect that basic word order.[53] Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:[28]

        FATHER
        
        LOVE
        
        CHILD
        
        "The father loves the child."[28]
        
        However, other word orders may also occur since ASL allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as topicalization.[54] In object–subject–verb (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:[</p>
